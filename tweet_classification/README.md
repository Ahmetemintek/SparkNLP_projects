# Disaster Tweet Classification with Universal Sentence Encoder
This project involves building a classification model that predicts whether tweets are about real disasters or not. The model utilizes the Universal Sentence Encoder for effective text representation.

## Project Files

- `train.csv`: The dataset used for training the classification model.
- `test.csv`: The dataset used for testing the model's performance.
- `final_submission.csv`: The submission format of the data prepared for the Kaggle competition.
- `USE_disaster_project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation of the classification model.

## Model Overview
The classification model leverages the Universal Sentence Encoder to transform tweets into meaningful embeddings, enabling the model to effectively discern between tweets that relate to actual disasters and those that do not.
