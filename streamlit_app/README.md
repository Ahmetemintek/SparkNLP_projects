# NLP Web App with SparkNLP_JSL

This project contains a Streamlit web application that performs several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the SparkNLP_JSL library. The app provides an interactive interface to perform the following NLP tasks:

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of textual data (positive, negative, neutral).
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify and classify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations in the text.
- Relation Extraction: Extract relationships between entities present in the text.
- Assertion Detection: Identify the assertion status of medical or factual entities in the text (e.g., present, absent, conditional).
- Deidentification: Automatically identify and anonymize sensitive information from text, such as personal or medical data.

### How to Run the App
- Install the required dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run the Streamlit app: Use the following command to start the app:
- `streamlit run jsl.py`

- Open the app in your browser: Once the app is running, a local URL will be provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`). Open this in your browser to start using the app.
