# Text Summarization with T5 Transformer
This project implements a text summarization pipeline and applies it to a dataset of text. The summarization is powered by the T5 Transformer model using SparkNLP.

## Key Features
- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generates concise summaries from the provided text data using T5's pre-trained "summary" task.
- **No Pre-processing Required**: T5's "summary" task is designed to handle raw text input, so no additional text pre-processing steps were implemented.

## Files Included
- text_summarization.ipynb: The notebook containing the complete implementation of the text summarization pipeline using SparkNLP and T5.

  
## Model
The project leverages the T5 Transformer for generating high-quality summaries. The T5 model has been pre-trained on a wide variety of text sources, making it well-suited for summarization tasks without the need for extensive data preparation.
