# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects Showcase

This repository showcases fundamental **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects implemented using **PySpark** and **SparkNLP**. 

The goal of this repository is to provide simple examples that cover essential NLP concepts and their implementation with PySpark and SparkNLP. The projects included serve as a starting point for anyone looking to learn about NLP and understand the basic functionalities of PySpark and SparkNLP.

## Repository Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a different NLP task or technique.
- Inside each project folder, youâ€™ll find:
  - Project files (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, datasets).
  - A README file that gives an overview of the project, the methodology used, and how to execute the code.

These projects aim to provide a **general introduction** to NLP with the help of **PySpark** and **SparkNLP**, covering fundamental operations like text processing, tokenization, named entity recognition, and more.

Feel free to explore the different projects to gain insights into how NLP tasks are implemented using these powerful libraries!
