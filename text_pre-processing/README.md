# Text Pre-processing Pipeline for NLP
This project implements essential text pre-processing steps that can be applied to any NLP task. These steps are combined into a single, streamlined pipeline, making it easy to prepare raw text data for further NLP tasks.

### Files Included
text_preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the text pre-processing pipeline.
data.csv: The dataset used in the project for demonstrating the pre-processing steps.
### Pre-processing Steps
The pipeline includes the following basic text pre-processing techniques:

- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not add significant meaning.
- Punctuation Removal: Stripping punctuation to focus on the textual content.
- Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form.
